This is a small collection of some of the Java code I have written throughout my PhD. Some of it was for class exercises others are just some practice problems
which range from statistical analysis to biological problems. Each file name should give a good indication of what is contained within the file.

Some of these are not complete or are being worked on when needed. Check back for any updates
